# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis – Python & Pandas  
A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding why customers leave a bank.  
This project uses **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib** to uncover key patterns, behaviors, and financial indicators that affect churn.

# 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a major concern in the banking industry.  
This project explores a real-world styled **Bank Customer Churn Dataset** to identify:

- Which customers are more likely to churn  
- Which customer profiles remain loyal  
- Key behavioral and financial indicators  
- Hidden insights that drive customer decisions  
- High-value customers at risk  

This analysis delivers clear, actionable insights through a structured EDA approach.

# 🧠 Objectives of This Project  
- Understand demographic, behavioral, and financial factors linked to churn  
- Explore churn trends across countries, genders, ages, products, and salaries  
- Build 25+ unique analytical questions to uncover deep insights  
- Visualize trends using charts (bar, pie, line)  
- Build a value scoring system to identify highest-value churners  
- Provide meaningful business conclusions
